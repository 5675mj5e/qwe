I've always been very annoyed when I've decided to do an update with the Tomtom Home software just before I dash out somewhere in a hurry, only to have it. Today I found that there is a new firmware update for my GO , , RIDER, RIDER2, ONE XL, ONE XL S, GO , GO LIVE, EASE. Download and update firmware for products: carminat tomtom firmware update, android firmware new tomtom gps part 5, official firmware tomtom rider 

That's what I thought. Firmware GSW has a problem since April 7th, It's possible via unofficial ways to update this firmware to GSW which will work fine again. TomTom published this update for other models, but sadly never for the One 3rd.  · Hey Im wondering if its possible to replace the TomTom's OS with a alternative one with some more programs, different GPS sources/maps, etc Its a TomTom XL IQ Routes.
