I've gotten this board working great as a Hackintosh (search tonymacx86 forums for "Mini Beast"). The only thing that doesn't work is WiFi, but I use GigE. I've got Catalina mostly working on a GA-Z97N-WIFI motherboard. The biggest missing item is sound! Build is via the Sidebar vanilla guide. cxcom › Tags.
